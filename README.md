# MPT_Opti
My attempt to use Python to run modern portfolio theory optimization on equity only portfolios.

Almost entierly based on https://towardsdatascience.com/efficient-frontier-portfolio-optimisation-in-python-e7844051e7f and source material refrenced in it.

See Excel file for how I would normally do this with the solver add-on.
